### This Repo is to showcase my GenAI project created over Streamlit (Python + Langchain)
1st Project is simple Chatbot powered by opensource LLMs of Groq that give Response to the query of the user. 
2nd Project is RAG Document QnA Chatbot used to provide the insites of the uploaded documents currently it supports pdf files and text files later i have plans to add compatibitlity of images. In this Project I created a chatbot that help user to get specific answer from large books as user dont have tor read entire documents. I implemented RAG to create this BOT.

3rd Project is all about the RAG with message history earlier the given chatbot is not able to manage the chat history and user have to provide the context about his query now if user asked one question this chatbot have history that can manage the chat history and answer on the basis of the previous chat.

4th Project for AI Agent.
Tools and Agents :These are the important part of Generative AI field: Before Introducing about my project let me explain what actually is Tools and Agents:

Tools: Tools are basically a function or External function that can capable to perform a specific task very efficiently and you all know AI is train over user data or Large data set then i preety obvious that AI can not be truly efficient in performing all these tasks so tools are used to provide functionality to AI model for performing specific task.

Agents:Agents are like smart decision makers that knows how to use tools and where to use which tool.

it is a AI Project that implement different tools for solving user query through AI. It has wikipedia , arxiv , DuckDuckgosearch tool provided by langchain and one self made tool for Web based query .In this Project i created a AI agent that help user to find its query from different tools.
